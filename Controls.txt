Welcome to the StarRoids game.
Made in just 2 weeks from scratch for the SyntaxBomb July 2017 Indie Coder 'code a game' competition.

Controls are:-
    LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to rotate your ship.
    UP arrow to thrust forward.
    SPACE to shoot.

    When you see a 'power up' icon, move your ship into it to pick up.
    When you get a 'bomb power up', press the DOWN arrow key to 'drop the bomb'.

    ESCAPE quits the game.

Quick guide:
    LEFT & RIGHT - steer ship
    UP           - thrust
    SPACE        - fire
    DOWN         - Use bomb
